## 4. Theme

I am using Monokai theme. It is paid, and I have paid for it and recommend you to do it, as it is a very good theme with nice icons.

I have also added some color customizations to the workbench, so the theme looks even more organic and beautiful. You can check these customizations in the settings.json file under `// Workbench settings` comment. It mostly customizes the bottom line.
