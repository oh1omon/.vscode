## VSCode config

This repository represents my VSCode config.

Right now I have decided to move to Nvim, but this config will stay here, and in case of emergency, I will get back here. And please, don't hesitate to try it yourself. :D

## Keymaps

I have currently only one custom key map.

- View: Toggle Terminal - CTRL + § (Basically CTRL and the button to the left of 1)

## Config

You can find it under settings.json file

## Theme

I am using Monokai theme. It is paid, and I have paid for it and recommend you to do it, as it is a very good theme with nice icons.

I have also added some color customizations to the workbench, so the theme looks even more organic and beautiful. You can check these customizations in the settings.json file under `// Workbench settings` comment. It mostly customizes the bottom line.
